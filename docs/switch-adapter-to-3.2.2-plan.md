# Switch Adapter to 3.2.2 Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps to modify the testing environment to use a local version of the ExChain Analytics adapter (v3.2.2) while maintaining the rest of the Prebid.js build from the production version at lwgadm.com.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Create a Proxy Layer for the Adapter
- Load the original Prebid.js from lwgadm.com
- Override just the ExChain Analytics adapter with our local version
- Keep all other modules and functionality exactly as they are

### 2. Implementation Steps

#### a. Create `adapter-proxy.js`
- Load the original Prebid.js from lwgadm.com
- Define a custom module loader that intercepts only the ExChain adapter
- Inject our local adapter version (3.2.2) when Prebid.js requests it
- Leave all other module loading unchanged

#### b. Modify `server.js`
- Keep the existing Prebid.js proxy functionality
- Add a new route specifically for the ExChain adapter
- Serve our local adapter version when requested
- Maintain all existing debugging instrumentation

### 3. File Structure Changes
```
Exchain_EK_Proxy_Test/
├── server.js (modified to handle adapter proxy)
├── adapter-proxy.js (new file for adapter interception)
├── docs/
│   └── exchainAnalyticsAdapter_v3.2.2/
│       └── exchain-ioid-fix.js (our new adapter version)
└── ... (rest of the existing structure)
```

### 4. Testing Environment Impact
- The change will be transparent to the testing environment
- All debugging instrumentation will continue to work
- The race condition testing will still be valid
- Only the adapter implementation will be different

### 5. Advantages of this Approach
- Minimal changes to existing code
- No need to rebuild Prebid.js
- Easy to switch between adapter versions
- Maintains exact production environment for all other modules
- Debugging capabilities remain intact

### 6. Verification Steps
- Verify the original Prebid.js is loaded correctly
- Confirm our local adapter is being used instead of the production one
- Ensure all other modules remain unchanged
- Validate that debugging instrumentation still works
- Test that the race condition can still be observed

## Next Steps
1. Create the adapter proxy layer
2. Test the proxy implementation
3. Modify server.js to handle the adapter proxy
4. Verify the changes work as expected
5. Document any additional findings or requirements

## Notes
- This approach ensures we can test the new adapter version without disrupting the existing testing environment
- The plan maintains the ability to easily switch back to the production adapter if needed
- All debugging and testing capabilities remain intact
